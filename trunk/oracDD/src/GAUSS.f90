!!$==========================================================================
!!$ Program to produce exponentially correlated colored (Gaussian) noise.
!!$ based on Fox et al Physical Review A vol.38(1988)5938 and 
!!$ modification of GASDEV from Numerical Recipes for Fortran(2nd ed.pg279)
!!$
!!$ CAPE is capital E in the article by Fox et. al.
!!$ PREV is the previous value of CGAUSS used in the next iteration
!!$ L1ME2 is the main parameters causing colored noise in Fox et al
!!$       and represents (lamda*(1-E)^2). Ditto for H in that article.
!!$
!!$ routine is illustrated in Double Precision in case it is needed in this
!!$ mode, otherwise all Double Precision variables maybe changed to REAL
!!$ but the corresponding changes must be made to CGAUS0 and the calling
!!$ programs.
